									<p>Once the first susceptibility map is created, we need to validate the result. To do this, 
										a validation script is run in R. This script requires reclassifying the susceptibility map layer
										 into two simple classes, 0 and 1. All pixels falling in the 0 - 0.5 range are assigned a 0, indicating 
										 no hazard, while those in the 0.5 - 1 range are assigned a 1, indicating a hazard. This new layer is compared
										  with the testing points layer created earlier to determine the accuracy level.
										</p>
									<p>From the susceptibility map, it is clear that the analyzed area is heavily affected by landslides,
										 with most of the region characterized by "moderate" and "high" risk levels</p>

								<p>The initial overall accuracy is 0.506, which is quite low. To improve this, 
									we can increase the number of training points used to create the susceptibility map, 
									thus enhancing the level of detail in the information.</p>	
								<p>Increasing the number of training points leads to a significant improvement in accuracy,
									 which rises by 0.1 points to reach 0.83. This is a much better result, as it is well above 0.8 and shows
									  a substantial improvement compared to the 1,000 points version. Possible reasons for this significant change 
									  will be discussed later in this section.</p>	
								<p>The final step involved selecting certain elements in the analyzed area to understand their exposure to the various landslide 
									risks defined earlier: population, buildings, and forested areas were chosen.</p>		
								<p>Starting with the first class, selected to understand what percentage of the population is actually
									 affected by landslide risk, the charts below show that the data extracted from the models suggest 
									that most of the population is subject to "high" or "very high" landslide risk.</p>

								<p>Regarding buildings, chosen because they are sites that can attract a large number of people, 
									they are primarily located in areas with "moderate" or "high" landslide risk.</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/building_exp.jpg" style="width: 70%; height: auto;" alt="" class="reduced-size centered-image" /></div>
								<p>Finally, the forested areas, similar to the previous class, 
									show that most of the analyzed forest areas fall into the "moderate" or "high" risk categories.</p>
